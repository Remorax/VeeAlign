# Value of K in K-fold sliding window in `evaluation.py`
# Determines splitting of data into training (1-1/K) and validation (1/K) in `train.py`

# Determines if training data should be split on ontology level (True) or on element level (False)
# Set to True if you wish to train and test on ontology pairs, or False otherwise (recommended),  as in most cases.

[Preprocessing]
# Whether or not to use spellcheck for preprocessing. 
# Generally recommended, but set it to False if training data is domain specific (eg. biomedical)
# or in a non-English language

# Determines if weighted sum should be used to obtain unified path representation, or max pooling should be used
